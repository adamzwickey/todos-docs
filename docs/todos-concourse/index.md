## Todo(s) Concourse

Howdy and welcome.  What is this?

This repository contains Concourse pipelines to automate release and delivery of the Todo set of apps and such.  Concourse is pipelining for a more civilized age, it's built with containers in mind and thus every Resource in Concourse is a container, whether it be to run a bunch of bash scripts or interacting with git repositories.  Central concepts are the Pipeline, Resources, Tasks and Jobs, all must-have primitives for ci/cd.

Go my friend to one of these fine resources...get Concourse and fly.

1. Concourse via Docker (shown here)
2. BOSH deployed Concourse
3. PCF deployed Concourse

## Using the pipelines

The pipelines assume the existence of **source-code**, in the context of the Todo set of apps such **source-code** is backed back individual git repositories.
